# A/B-Testing
A/B Testing in Data Science

<h2>What is A/B Testing?</h2>
<p>It is comparing two versions of a product and for example, comparing the older and newer versions of a mobile device.</p>
<p>Novelty effect - liking of new updates for a short period by customers.</p>
<p>Change Aversion - not liking the new update by the user.</p>

<p>var1 is product A.</p>
<p>var2 is product B.</p>

<p>By plotting data and hypothesis testing we can find the amount of significant change in the graph which will give us answers if it's a novelty effect or change aversion. This analysis will help the organization in finding if the update they have made is a good choice or not.</p>
